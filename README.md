Project Description
A shopping assistant that reads your mood from your face and mic, then recommends products accordingly. Feeling sad? Here’s ice cream. Feeling happy? Here’s a party hat.

The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
People spend hours browsing online stores because their brains just can't decide. What if your face could do the shopping for you?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We use simulated emotion detection to let your mood control your shopping cart. You don’t need to think anymore — your feelings now have retail power. Say goodbye to buyer’s remorse and hello to mood-based impulse buying! 🛍️🧠
